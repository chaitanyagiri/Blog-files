The wide variety it offers is just uncompetitive. But its biggest drawback is that <strong>it isn’t available in India.</strong> You can’t keep 17% of the total world population away from something as good as spotify.(Yes, I know not everyone has access to Internet but thats a discussion for some other day).</p><p>I was working on some project and suddenly I felt a sudden need to hear some good music to pace up my work and refresh my mood. I realized I don’t have much option in this case and every option available had some major drawbacks let me list down a few — </p><ul><li>Youtube — heavy data consumption, bad suggestion engine</li><li>Wynk , saavn, gaana etc.— Paid, Heavy advertisements (even in between songs), shitty collection.</li></ul><p>So with lots of effort(Not so much) I figured out how to use spotify in a country where they don’t offer their services even without any proxy server(YES it is possible). With only minutes of research you will be able to find out that they(Spotify) do not continuously check for your location but they do it only when you login/sign up for the application so you only have to somehow bypass the authentication part and you will be good to go.</p><p>Follow these steps — </p><ul><li>Download Zenmate or any other proxy extension/addon</li><li>Download spotify app available for windows, linux(YES), Mac, android and ios</li><li>Log in to facebook using your default browser.</li><li>Turn on Zenmate proxy and select USA or any supported country (just few clicks in UI, you’ll have to use it just once don’t worry I keep my promises).</li><li>Open the app and login to the Spotify using facebook it will open your default browser in which proxy is running you can verify your account there. It’ll redirect you to the app/website.</li><li>Just turn off the proxy and remove extension temporarily(if you want). Boom you are done open spotify app and play whatever you want.</li></ul><p>For more such content follow me on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chaitanyagiri.ga" target="_blank" rel="noopener">instagram</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/chaitanyagiri" target="_blank" rel="noopener">twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/chaitanyagiri" target="_blank" rel="noopener">github</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@chaitanyagiri" target="_blank" rel="noopener">medium</a> .

This article covers following challenges —</p><ul><li><a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/react/render-html-elements-to-the-dom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Render HTML Elements to the DOM</a></li><li><a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/react/define-an-html-class-in-jsx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Define an HTML Class in JSX</a></li><li><a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/react/learn-about-self-closing-jsx-tags" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn About Self-Closing JSX Tags</a></li><li><a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/react/create-a-stateless-functional-component" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Create a Stateless Functional Component</a></li></ul><p>You will encounter terms like DOM, rendering, Virtual DOM etc or even you might have already heard about them.</p><p>So how all these are important to you, your browser and react?</p><h4 id="DOM-and-Virtual-DOM"><a href="#DOM-and-Virtual-DOM" class="headerlink" title="DOM and Virtual DOM"></a>DOM and Virtual DOM</h4><p>We take an example of an MVC(Model View Controller) structure application(A architectural structure of an application). As you already know any working full stack web application has a database, frontend, and events that help you interact with the application. So wise people in the world after years of trying and testing different patterns of an application’s architecture came up with some standard architectural patterns, we call them <strong>Design Patterns</strong>. MVC is one of the widely used patterns. Below diagram shown below will clear things a bit.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*nUNIrur1X0PhdSCLxXeouQ.png" alt="chaitanya giri react tutorial"></p><p style="font-size:13px">MVC structure.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*alzPxNPbQiLdV2DctKWzww.png" alt="chaitanya giri react tutorial"></p><p style="font-size:13px">Virtual DOM</p><p>So whats with the middle man i.e, virtual DOM why not we do things directly to DOM? The answer is simple time it saves us a lot of time if we introduce a virtual DOM.</p><p>DOM (Document Object Model) is a node tree that saves all the elements in a tree like structure and remakes the whole tree every time when you reload a page. While our friend <strong>Virtual DOM</strong> here it is also a node tree but it contains just the react components in it and it <strong>rebuilds everything</strong> under that component every time the component gets rendered. The virtual DOM is so fast that it can produce <strong>200,000 nodes per second.</strong></p><p>Rendering is the process where Virtual DOM under a component is rebuild due to state change etc. and the actual DOM is updated through an algorithm named diffing algorithm (Thats way too much to know for a beginner).</p><p>This is how messy it is and believe me I have barely scratched the surface while telling you this though it could be very interesting to know how these all work but it is beyond the scope of this tutorial series. From my perspective you should at least have the overview of what all is happening under the hood. These terms will be used very frequently in future articles and challenges so it was necessary to have an idea of what the heck are those.</p><hr><h4 id="Solutions-and-Explanation-—"><a href="#Solutions-and-Explanation-—" class="headerlink" title="Solutions and Explanation —"></a>Solutions and Explanation —</h4><p>1, Render HTML Elements to the DOM<br></p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">const JSX = (</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&lt;div&gt;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&lt;p&gt;Lets render this to the DOM&lt;/p&gt;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&lt;/div&gt;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p></p><p>ReactDOM.render(JSX,document.getElementById(“challenge-node”));</p><p>The syntax to render using ReactDOM is <code>ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode)</code> first parameter in this case was constant <em>JSX</em> and second parameter is the element having id as <em>challenge-node</em> so we use document.getElementById() to access that element.</p><p>2, Define an HTML Class in JSX.<br></p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">const JSX = (\</span><br><span class="line">&lt;div&gt;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&lt;h1 className=&quot;myDiv&quot;&gt;Add a class to this div&lt;/h1&gt;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&lt;/div&gt;\</span><br><span class="line">);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p></p><p>This is very easy, you might have used <em>class</em> in HTML here since class is a reserved keyword in JavaScript hence instead of it <em>className</em> was chosen by people who were developing JSX as they wanted to make it as similar to HTML as possible.</p><p>3, Learn About Self-Closing JSX Tags<br></p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">const JSX = (\</span><br><span class="line">&lt;div&gt;\</span><br><span class="line">&lt;h2&gt;Welcome to React!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;br/&gt;\</span><br><span class="line">&lt;p&gt;Be sure to close all tags!&lt;/p&gt;\</span><br><span class="line">&lt;hr /&gt;\</span><br><span class="line">&lt;/div&gt;\</span><br><span class="line">);</span><br><span class="line">`</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p></p><p>If I explain this I would be making your fun. 😆</p><p>4, Create a Stateless Functional Component<br></p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">const MyComponent = function() &#123;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">return(</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&lt;div&gt;\</span><br><span class="line">This is a string.\</span><br><span class="line">&lt;/div&gt;\</span><br><span class="line">);</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p></p><p>Components are ideally follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single responsibility principle</a>, that is, a component should ideally only do one thing. Recall it was in the article that I recommended in the <a href="https://chaitanyagiri.ga/2018/07/20/Solving-React-challenges-from-FreeCodeCamp-Challenge-number-1-2-and-3/">last article</a>. So you may consider a component as a building block of a react app. By 20th challenge you would be creating components and manipulate them as you wish but for now here is a easy way to make a component though you would be using some other way to make components but for now this is the way you do it.</p><p>PS – You might have seen the writing variable names, function names, constant names etc is very strict, there is a thing to observe in any reputed book you would see JavaScript written as “JavaScript” not “javascript” not “JAVASCRIPT” this particular writing convention is known as <strong>camel case</strong>. Do a quick google search to find more about it.</p><p></p><hr><br>So this brings us to the end of second article in this tutorial series.<p></p><p>Don’t forget to follow me on <a href="http://instagram.com/irig_aynatiahc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">instagram</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/chaitanyagiri" target="_blank" rel="noopener">twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/chaitanyagiri" target="_blank" rel="noopener">github</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@chaitanyagiri" target="_blank" rel="noopener">medium</a> .</p><p>Happy Coding.</p>]]></content>

Let’s start.</p><hr><p>The initial challenges are pretty much on the easier side since you need to be comfortable when you are learning something new. This tutorial is covering 3 challenges namely:</p><ul><li><a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/react/create-a-simple-jsx-element" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Create a Simple JSX Element</a></li><li><a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/react/create-a-complex-jsx-element" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Create a Complex JSX Element</a></li><li><a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/react/add-comments-in-jsx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Add Comments in JSX</a></li></ul><p>Since all the three challenges deal with JSX lets learn about JSX first.</p><blockquote><p>JSX acts as a wooden bridge when you need to cross the river of HTML with the help of JavaScript(wood).</p></blockquote><p>Now whenever you need a way to understand any statement about JSX refer to this particular quote. For example —</p><p>“JSX is a syntactic extension of JavaScript” — A wooden bridge is indeed made up of wood.</p><p>Now if you have checked any <em>node_modules</em> folder there is a high probability that you have seen something like <em>Babel.</em> Babel essentially is a tool that allows the browser to convert JSX into Javascript (a form that it understands). At this point I’ll need to recommend an article that’ll help you understand react more have a look at this one <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thinking in React</a>.</p><h4 id="Solutions-and-explanation"><a href="#Solutions-and-explanation" class="headerlink" title="Solutions and explanation -"></a>Solutions and explanation -</h4><p>1, Create a Simple JSX Element</p><p>Sol-</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">const JSX = &lt;h1&gt;Hello JSX!&lt;/h1&gt;;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>2, Create a Complex JSX Element</p><p>Sol-</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">const JSX = &lt;div&gt;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&lt;h1&gt;This is a heading.&lt;/h1&gt;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&lt;ul&gt;\</span><br><span class="line">&lt;li&gt;This is first list item.&lt;/li&gt;\</span><br><span class="line">&lt;li&gt;This is second list item.&lt;/li&gt;\</span><br><span class="line">&lt;li&gt;This is third list item.&lt;/li&gt;\</span><br><span class="line">&lt;/ul&gt;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&lt;/div&gt;;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>A JSX is essentially a single element so if you have to add multiple elements you should wrap them inside a single div element.</p><p>3, Add Comments in JSX</p><p>Sol-</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">const JSX = (&lt;div&gt;</span><br><span class="line">&lt;h1&gt;This is a block of JSX&lt;/h1&gt;</span><br><span class="line">&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s a subtitle&lt;/p&gt;</span><br><span class="line">&#123;/* This is a Comment */&#125;</span><br><span class="line">&lt;/div&gt;);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>You might have observed the presence of parenthesis here it is a good practice to add parenthesis while defining a JSX constant. Try removing it and then running the tests(it’ll still pass all the test cases).</p><p>This brings us to the end of first tutorial. I totally agree that this was easier and you could have done it without any assistance but it did not have anything good that I could have explained. Next videos will surely have</p><p>Remember to follow me on <a href="http://instagram.com/irig_aynatiahc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">instagram</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/chaitanyagiri" target="_blank" rel="noopener">twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/chaitanyagiri" target="_blank" rel="noopener">github</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@chaitanyagiri" target="_blank" rel="noopener">medium</a> .

This is the story of us meeting finally.</p><p>There are four of us, the classic high school buddies. Quick profiles:-</p><ul><li>Chimta ( Yash )</li><li>Naag (Ankush)</li><li>Billa (Chhailesh)</li><li>Katora (Me)</li></ul><p>Now I collected Billa and Naag and we planned to meet Chimta at his place and then decide where to go.</p><p>After an hour of discussion we all agreed upon Biryani. There were 3 options nearby so obviously we chose the 4th one 31 Kms away from the city. Chimta is good at driving(they say) so he was driving.</p><p>We were on highway, now Naag is a bit cocky and cautious so he told us this story of 2 guys getting killed in an accident when their car was surrounded by heavy trucks from the 3 sides and the truck at the back crushed their car. At the same moment the most obvious thing happens we somehow get surrounded by trucks on the three sides and every one is now recalling his story except Naag I asked “<em>teri kyon nahi fat rahi hai</em>?”(how are you so calm?) to which he replied “<em>Jo do log mare the wo aage baithe the car mein piche wale zinda the!</em>“(the two guys who died were sitting in the front). Laughter bursts in the car, now the trucks have cleared our way but as with all stories the laughter could not last longer front right tire got punctured after a horrifying sound “<strong>BOOM</strong>“.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*mN-dC7HVhjsYSD_OEPxtbg.jpeg" alt=""></p><p>The car went out of control and first went right and then extreme left and we are off the road. For the next 5 mins all of us were still as rock . I break the silence “had it happened while we were in between those trucks two of you would have been dead”.</p><h4 id="Laughter-bursts-again"><a href="#Laughter-bursts-again" class="headerlink" title="Laughter bursts again."></a>Laughter bursts again.</h4><p>Now after getting tire fixed “Biryani important hai babu” (Biriyani is important). Due to the incident we decided to stop by a temple to thank god for saving our lives. So we stopped by a “Sai Baba” temple. There was this one guy inside the temple who was singing devotional songs with harmonium he was using microphone to amplify his songs so it was audible all around the temple premises. As soon as I entered the temple I spotted a beautiful girl inside the temple. After we were done praying I felt it was my duty to make sure all of us spotted that girl. So I whispered hot chick at 3 o’clock but none were able to listen as the guy with harmonium was pretty loud. Then I again said <strong>hot chick at 3 o’clock</strong> still none heard me. So I decided to shout considering the songs will be loud enough and only they will hear me. So I shouted <strong>HOT CHICK AT 3 O’CLOCK!</strong> and at the very moment the guy stopped singing and all that anyone in the temple could hear was “<strong>HOT CHICK AT 3’O CLOCK!</strong>“. Everyone started looking at me with disgust I was very embarrassed. Before I could say a thing Chimta, Billa and Naag were gone.</p><p>I slowly walked out of the temple with my head staring at my foot constantly till I made my way to the car. So on that day I ate Biryani, terror and humiliation.</p>]]></content>

    <title>Possible changes that Microsoft could do to Github.</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The news has been there and it has finally happened. <strong>Microsoft bought Github for 7.5 billion</strong>(paid in stocks).</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*eEbeMOxS9L1hFXzb5KP5-A.jpeg" alt=""></p><h4 id="But-why-did-it-happened"><a href="#But-why-did-it-happened" class="headerlink" title="But why did it happened?"></a>But why did it happened?</h4><p>Despite being such a great platform for developers Github has been struggling financially It has barely been in profit since it launched plus there has not been the guy who was the face and leader. I always say to sustain a company you need a face behind it. So leadership issues and financial issues led to this.</p><h4 id="Why-Microsoft"><a href="#Why-Microsoft" class="headerlink" title="Why Microsoft?"></a>Why Microsoft?</h4><p>Suppose you were a company dealing with IT and you get data related to technologies from the developers all around the world? Very less people know Microsoft had its own Github like platform called Codeplex which was shut down recently on December 15th, 2017 so that’s one way of thinking.</p><p>As a developer I am really concerned about this acquisition as I push most of my public code to Github.</p><p>A quote from Microsoft’s blog “GitHub is the de facto place for open source sharing and most open source projects have migrated there”. Microsoft has been actively pushing open source technology, and the company has open sourced PowerShell, Visual Studio Code, and the Microsoft Edge JavaScript engine. Microsoft also partnered with Canonical to bring Ubuntu to Windows 10 and acquired Xamarin to assist with mobile app development.</p><p>So if I were Microsoft I wouldn’t want to miss the deal.</p><h4 id="Changes-this-acquisition-could-bring-to-github-—"><a href="#Changes-this-acquisition-could-bring-to-github-—" class="headerlink" title="Changes this acquisition could bring to github —"></a>Changes this acquisition could bring to github —</h4><ul><li>While the first <a href="https://natfriedman.github.io/hello/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog</a> posted by Nat Friedman(New CEO of Github) clearly mentions that it will operate independently as a community, platform, and business and will retain its product philosophy. But Microsoft’s business model tells you otherwise. Microsoft’s business model relies on proprietary technology(selling software e.g. windows). So <strong>it could limit the free account’s services</strong>.</li><li>Integrating LinkedIn careers with Github jobs. Since both of them are now serving same purpose to same company they are likely to get merged.</li><li>Microsoft is the top contributor to Github as an organization. And if you have been following the news it has turned its many code bases open source over the last few years so It could make some giant products open source revolutionizing the developers community(Maybe Windows).</li><li>Using Github’s stats/trends in technology to adjust its products accordingly.</li><li>Changing User Interface while I feel the Github’s classic UI do not need any changes but people can still expect this to be changing as Github has itself been experimenting with the UI so Microsoft could also do the same but in a more massive manner.</li><li>Despite the expected limitations in free services you could expect a boost in customer support as Microsoft’s basic idea has always been to build their products and services around customer’s needs this could very well be possible.</li></ul><p>So the changes could be very drastic or it could lead to a better Github Let’s see what happens.</p><p>Follow me on <a href="https://github.com/chaitanyagiri" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github</a> for more updates on my recent projects.

There has been a lot of buzz for data science among the developer community. But some questions do arise when it comes to practical impacts that it has produced over these years or will produce in the coming years.</p><h4 id="So-what-is-Data-Science"><a href="#So-what-is-Data-Science" class="headerlink" title="So, what is Data Science?"></a>So, what is Data Science?</h4><blockquote><p>In God we trust, all others must bring data.- William Edwards Deming</p></blockquote><p>The Internet is responsible to produce enormous amount of data since its origin. It carries information about various users, their Internet usage, their search queries and what not. These data when used properly, it can predict great things with greater accuracy.</p><p>So, data science deals with the process that involves extraction of valuable results, observations and insights from these data.</p><h4 id="Is-it-worth-so-much-discussion"><a href="#Is-it-worth-so-much-discussion" class="headerlink" title="Is it worth so much discussion?"></a>Is it worth so much discussion?</h4><p>Remember the predictions that we discussed above. Now suppose you are able to predict what your user is interested in buying just by seeing his search queries from the week, now you are able to put relevant ads for every user. Suppose you are able to guess the stability in the stock market just by going through previous stock prices. Suppose you are able to predict some natural calamity before it happens just by looking at previous data of natural disasters. These all are among those infinitely many crucial things that can impact you and industries around you directly.</p><h4 id="It’s-impact-in-industries"><a href="#It’s-impact-in-industries" class="headerlink" title="It’s impact in industries."></a>It’s impact in industries.</h4><p>Data is no more just data it has become a powerful tool to leverage your company in many aspects like:</p><ul><li><strong>Marketing</strong> — With proper implementation of data science, a company now knows what type of advertisements should be shown to what type of users/potential users. Also maintaining them is easier than ever.</li><li><strong>Product</strong> — A product can now be tested and automated through available datasets of real world users. Now companies are less prone to bugs that’ll cost them millions of dollars if not found.</li><li><strong>Sales</strong> —Finding the perfect audience is a major factor to increase the revenues of any organization. Analyzing the data about previous customer transactions, about the product in demand, the demographics of the customers etc. could help identify who to target on.</li><li><strong>User-End Applications</strong> — A decent amount of companies providing solutions to many data science related problem have emerged in recent times. These companies not only increase the usage of data analytics and data science but also help the community of people who want to have their career in this field.</li><li><strong>Automation</strong> — Different industries have felt the data science revolution by observing the sudden increase in automation. Many repetitive, complex jobs that required labor are now automated. While it’s very less likely to happen that AI/automation will take over most of the jobs but this surely has led to increase in unemployment.</li></ul><p>Data Science has opened many doors for industries in many fields like health-care, agriculture, education etc. It has made the much-needed impact that has not been made in the industries for years. This is surely a boon for our society</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since medium tells me that I have some international readers so I thought that I should explain Indian reservation system to them. Indians(protesters) who claim to already know about it might also want to consider reading it.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/716/1*bIErugBlKZ7zApV4Rlfy6g.jpeg" alt=""></p><p><a href="http://writm.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://writm.com</a></p><p>Indian reservation system was started way before independence (Search for British influence in India) by Maharajah of Kolhapur in 1891(supposedly) in his own reign. His 1902 measures created 50 per cent reservation for backward communities.</p><p><strong>Q. Was reservation even required back then?</strong></p><p><strong>A.</strong> YES! in fact, you can’t even imagine the condition of people back then. Despite all the good things that Indian civilization possessed it had some major drawbacks, for example, Sati Pratha, Untouchability etc. While Indians were already getting harassed by Britishers the backward community’s condition was even worse some so-called upper caste people of India used their superiority in the community to harass the backward communities.</p><p><strong>Q</strong>. <strong>What are these backward communities and how they were formed?</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>. The place where I come from backward communities were usually those people who were not able to keep up with the changes in the world or better say did not have opportunities/facilities like other people. Indian caste system classified the society in principle into four varnas(types):</p><p>1, Brahmin- priests, scholars and teachers.\<br>2, Kshatriya- rulers, warriors and administrators.\<br>3, Vaishya- agriculturalists and merchants.\<br>4, Shudra- labourers and service providers.</p><p>Apart from these types, the unclassified ones were called avarna most of the people who have reservation nowadays belong to this category. While it may look like it is been a discriminative classification but the people who were responsible for this were the most genius brains at that time and even now. This system was robust, every part of the society had equal importance and every part of society was required to work efficiently for a community to grow.</p><p>But the influence of other civilizations like Mughals, Europeans and British made it the way it is now. There was indeed a loophole in the Indian caste system. <strong><em>Now instead of classifying people on the basis of the work they do they were classified on the basis of caste they were born in.</em></strong></p><p>Presently reservation in India exists in employment, education and elected bodies.</p><p><strong>Q. Is reservation required now?</strong></p><p><strong>A.</strong> YES! I have seen people living in worst conditions only if they had proper education, and better opportunities their lifestyles would be way better than now. But as said by many global thinkers Indian reservation system needs some serious reforms. Now, remember the caste-based system which already had loopholes, the people who drafted the Indian Constitution<strong>(I don’t think that’s just one person to be credited or blamed for this)</strong> forgot about the loophole and again took the same cast based system as a foundation to define new reservation system.</p><p>PS- I am a peace loving person. I take stand on what I said and these are my views I do not want to hurt any sentiments and please don’t kill me for this.</p>]]></content>

Every now and then we suffer data loss and this can be crucial when it comes to huge data that are essential for a company to even <strong>exist.</strong> Suppose next day you wakeup and open amazon to buy something and you do not find a single product 😆. Now this is very less likely to happen because we have replica set. (Note: Amazon do not use mongodb to store data this was an example, though they use a NoSQL database so it has to be something similar).</p><p>Replica set has been in mongodb for a while now, previously instead of replica set we had master-slave replication(Please refer some other article if you want to learn about this).</p><h3 id="How-does-it-work"><a href="#How-does-it-work" class="headerlink" title="How does it work?"></a>How does it work?</h3><p>Basically a replica set is multiple set of mongod instances that hosts same data(this can be tricky to say as in any instance some data might be put after some delay but for the moment let’s assume as it is).</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*4m_iWLMgg7W3cu0mYjUNsw.jpeg" alt=""></p><p>MongoDB replica set</p><p>Now assume we have a primary node that has multiple secondary nodes(max 50) say 2 in this case. When ever client writes or reads from primary node the primary node logs it in its oplog. Now the two secondary nodes replicate the oplog’s operations and in-turn has the same data as primary. Now this nodes are connected with the primary node with a heartbeat kind of structure in if the primary node does not reply to their heartbeats in 10 seconds. Secondary nodes do an election sort of thing to replace primary node(😢 So rude). Now if there are less than 7 secondary nodes and total number of secondary node is even then there is an extra node called <strong>Arbiter</strong> it do not replicates it simply participate in election so that in the election a draw among nodes never happens and if there are 7 or more nodes then any 7 will participate based on their priority value(more details ahead).</p><p>Secondary nodes also have a priority value attached to them which helps in election. The extract of this statement can be: If a node has priority value 0 then it will never be elected and it’ll always have the data with it so it provides an extra layer of security to data loss.(Amazon is safe 😆).</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*tDU3bK4zNcQDXP3TSDPKwA.jpeg" alt=""></p><p>MongoDB replica and arbiter</p><h3 id="Now-how-can-you-actually-setup-a-replica-set-in-MongoDB"><a href="#Now-how-can-you-actually-setup-a-replica-set-in-MongoDB" class="headerlink" title="Now how can you actually setup a replica set in MongoDB?"></a>Now how can you actually setup a replica set in MongoDB?</h3><ul><li>By default, MongoDB bind to local interface only, it will restrict the remote connections.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So first of all <strong>yay! 😄 😄</strong> I mentored pre-university students in <a href="https://codein.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Code-In’17</a>, I am so happy that I can’t even describe the feeling.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/716/1*dTEKWMpmzODJufrMh_7OMg.png" alt=""></p><p>See that blue picture of me. 😃</p><p>So, November was the month when it all started. I was preparing for the end term examinations, I wasn’t doing much of any other work as I need to focus on my grades (😜 they are a bit on the lower side).</p><p>One day I came across an article about GCI(<a href="https://codein.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Code-In</a>). I thought I must apply to be a part of this(Though didn’t expect to get selected).</p><p>Here are some points explaining the application procedure:</p><ul><li>Wait for next GCI to start.(Obviously 😜)</li><li>Each year different organizations are selected to be a part of GCI. You can easily see them <a href="https://codein.withgoogle.com/organizations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</li><li>Now next thing you need to do to apply as a mentor is get the mailing details or any type of communication platform that the organization prefers.</li><li>Introduce and simply ask how to join the community as a mentor for GCI. They’ll guide you.</li><li>You’ll be asked to describe yourself and show that you are worthy of being a mentor. Just simply tell them about the projects you have done, show them your Github profile(You need to be active on Github),your preferred tech-stack, tell them about your experience on different projects etc.Now, this step differs from organization to organization but the idea behind that remains the same.</li></ul><p>My experience with GCI was amazing, our organization was among the top organizations in terms of completed tasks( 😜 Though its not a competition among organizations still whats good is good). I interacted with more than 50 students from different countries all around the world, helped them in various domains like coding, designing, writing etc. Some of the students needed more help so even had to spend hours with the single student but at the end I saw it as an opportunity to give back to the community which has helped me learn so many things.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A Hackathon is a 24/48 hours competition in which you come up with an idea and a product(prototype). If you haven’t attended any hackathon yet let me tell you this thing you are missing out a whole lot of cool stuff.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*JKP-l7HSzSpFZsyUUEmgug.png" alt=""></p><p>GitHub Octopotter for SAF-AI</p><p>So when I came to know that a hackathon is going to happen at our university. I was so excited and could not wait and went ahead to form a team. Since certain tracks were made available so I kind of knew what kind of product we were going to make. So accordingly I approached a guy who was learning about machine learning and stuff so he (Vibhas Bhairav Singh) became the second member of our team. Then we needed a person with amazing graphic designing skills so that our product does not suck at least visually. So we approached one of our junior batch guy(Samyak) as he was a good designer and was not been approached by anyone yet.\<br>So I was responsible for the platform, Vibhas for machine learning and Samyak for designing.\<br>We were ready and then in some days, we started brainstorming ideas so we came up with the idea of SAF-AI. It was our product for the hackathon let me introduce you what <a href="https://github.com/saf-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><em>SAF-AI</em></strong></a> is and how we created it.</p><h3 id="SAF-AI"><a href="#SAF-AI" class="headerlink" title="SAF-AI"></a><a href="https://github.com/saf-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAF-AI</a></h3><ul><li>As​ ​per​ ​a​ ​2013​ ​report​ ​from​ ​the​ ​International​ ​Solid​ ​Waste​ ​Association​ ​(ISWA), ​only​ ​73.9​ ​percent​ ​of garbage​ ​generated​ ​is​ ​collected.​ ​That​ ​still​ ​looks​ ​like​ ​a​ ​good​ ​number.​ ​Isn’t​ ​it?​ ​Here’s​ ​a​ ​figure 1,840,000,000,000.​ ​This​ ​is​ ​the​ ​amount​ ​of​ ​waste​ ​generated​ ​in​ ​2013​ ​in​ ​kilograms​ ​and​ ​hence\<br>478,400,000,000​ ​kgs​ ​of​ ​waste​ ​were​ ​not​ ​even​ ​collected.​ ​This​ ​was​ ​stats​ ​from​ ​2013​ ​and​ ​over​ ​all​ ​these years​ ​it​ ​has​ ​become​ ​even​ ​worse. So​ ​all​ ​these​ ​years​ ​have​ ​passed,​ ​lots​ ​and​ ​lots​ ​of​ ​technology​ ​advancement​ ​happened​ ​but​ ​still, ​we​ ​can’t even​ ​locate​ ​garbage​ ​in​ ​our​ ​locality.</li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*-RtuU3M_WWg6BstfZBAPTw.png" alt=""></p><p>Logo SAF-AI</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/saf-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SAF-AI</strong></a> is a web application that provides a platform for people all around the world to locate garbage and its severity level in their locality not only this the data provided goes to our server and our ML algorithm clusters data and then finds the shortest path from the locations for the garbage truck to travel upon so that we can now not only locate garbage but also provide an efficient way to collect it.</li></ul><h3 id="Something-bad-happened"><a href="#Something-bad-happened" class="headerlink" title="Something bad happened"></a>Something bad happened</h3><ul><li>So we were struggling with the algorithm part of the application. we spent about 6 hours figuring out how to implement Dijkstra’s algorithm over our collected dataset. No progress we were tired and exhausted. So we left the algorithm part and went on to submit only the part where we clustered data.</li><li><strong>We didn’t even get evaluated</strong> I do not know what happened maybe it was the process of submission or anything. But after getting rejected we all went to sleep. When we woke up and some of my friends asked me to show my project I opened the database and boom it was empty. Not a single response. If the judges have opened the application we would have got some data in our database. People were trying to buck me up but yeah I was depressed for the fact that we did not even get evaluated for some silly mistake.</li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DuQCQi3tdPQv2gSdiw8kgw.png" alt=""></p><p>Laptop mockup</p><h3 id="Something-good-happened"><a href="#Something-good-happened" class="headerlink" title="Something good happened"></a>Something good happened</h3><blockquote><p>So, believe it or not, life’s a<strong>it won’t let a single of </strong>mistake<strong> go uncounted and it won’t let a single of your </strong>effort** go in vain.</p></blockquote><ul><li>I came across another bigger hackathon where you have to present your idea and they select you to come to their place and then make the product there. If you were selected all of your expenses(Food, accommodation, travel) will be paid by them. <strong>I unknowingly applied for the same</strong>.</li><li><strong>Hurray! we got selected</strong>. Deep inside I knew It was a great idea and great things find a way to success. All we have to do is go there and make the product and all the expenses will be paid by them and the better part is more than 3000 people applied for it and only 170 were shortlisted.\<br>Can there be any reason why we would not go? YES, its one word containing 5 alphabets. It’s called EXAMS. So the dates were clashing and hence we could not go but the fact that we got selected was enough for us.</li></ul><p>Next, we will complete this project may be under the guidance of some faculty or alone who cares. What we care is that we learned a lot in these days.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/716/1*S6WRdAHcg-wLeXEHP0KcZw.jpeg" alt=""></p><p>Image via: ebs.ie</p><p>I write mostly about tech. So whats the need to even think out of context. Trust me I won’t, if situation would not have been this serious. I may get some ** feminist comments but I think its worth taking a risk.</p><p>Do you know what day was celebrated yesterday? Come on make a guess? Most of you might have already guessed it as the heading says it all (<em>FacePalm</em>). Let me tell you yesterday was International Men’s Day.</p><p>I usually don’t mind much about dates(the ones in calendar of-course 😜 ). But I always believe statistics can tell a lot. So I have a habit of using <a href="http://trends.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google trends</a> I observe and analyze data to produce useful and amazing(sometimes shocking) results. So I was going through it and found plenty of things to worry about:</p><p>1, It showed “International Men’s day” was searched 15 times more on March than on November. Fun fact: International Men’s day is celebrated on 19th November and International Women’s day on 8th March. People are so ignorant that they tend to search about “Men’s day” on Women’s day rather than on Men’s day.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/716/1*KxcSj8fbbcW31LmcRASylQ.png" alt=""></p><p>See the peak in March.</p><p>Women’s Day = 1, Men’s Day = 0.</p><p>2, So I went ahead and continued this interesting research a bit to find out that comparing query searches of “International Men’s Day” and “International Women’s Day” was even worse.(Google-Trends converts its data in percentage automatically.) Percentage of people who searched for “Men’s Day” was close to ZERO (0) while percentage of people who searched for “Women’s Day” was close to 100 annually.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/716/1*tU3zk_VlEPhJKYfY7yELJQ.png" alt=""></p><p>Red = International Women’s Day ; Blue = International Men’s Day</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/716/1*daxYP1prnktx4frzo9WI_Q.png" alt=""></p><p><strong><strong>__</strong></strong>Red = “International Women’s Day” searches more than “International men’s day” searches. <strong><strong>__</strong></strong>Blue = “International Men’s Day” searches more than “International women’s day” searches.</p><p>Women’s Day = 2, Men’s Day = 0.</p><p>3, Now this one is actually funny as well as shocking. People actually searched for “Is there an International Men’s Day”. Really, who ever did that must be having an existential crisis.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/716/1*mpzB9JUoUKHmITkIhOQiKw.png" alt=""></p><p>Look in related query section.</p><p>Women’s Day = 3, Men’s Day = -1 (People searched “Is there an International Men’s Day”)</p><p>These are not merely stats, these are the reflection of what world has become. Instead of promoting equality among genders and implementing practical solutions people are hyping topics people are using terms like “feminism” to grind their own axes.</p><p>So what happened here is people have hyped this thing so much that it don’t even feel like equality. It feels like it has been burdened upon us. We must understand at the end of the day terms do not matter what matters is the intentions.</p><p>Feel free to share this and comment to discuss more about it.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here, enjoy this song while reading the story: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBumgq5yVrA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Let her go</a>. (No they didn’t paid me). Click <a href="https://medium.com/@16ucc028/summarizing-ydkjs-up-going-chapter-1-5efff3096483" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> to read summary of UP &amp; GOING chapter 1.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*JOw6-O9fPWSV8O1oSfzfGg.jpeg" alt=""></p><p>YDKJS Up and Going</p><hr><p>So, the heading of this chapter is “<a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20%26%20going/ch2.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Into JavaScript</a>“. This really takes you a bit deeper <strong><em>into</em></strong> JavaScript learning.</p><ul><li>Recall that there are 6 type of variables: String, Number, Boolean, null and undefined, object, symbol as already mentioned in previous story.</li></ul><blockquote><p>The <code>object</code> type refers to a compound value where you can set properties (named locations) that each hold their own values of any type. This is perhaps one of the most useful value types in all of JavaScript.</p></blockquote><p>var obj = {\<br>a: “hello world”,\<br>b: 42,\<br>c: function foo(){ console.log(“Hello World”)}\<br>/<em>YES EVEN THAT\<br>IS POSSIBLE</em>/\<br>};\<br>obj.a;//hello world\<br>obj[“b”];//42</p><blockquote><p>An array is an <code>object</code> that holds values (of any type) not particularly in named properties/keys, but rather in numerically indexed positions. For example:</p></blockquote><p>var arr = [\<br>“hello world”,\<br>42,\<br>true\<br>];</p><p>arr[0]; //hello world</p><ul><li>arrays are special objects (as <code>typeof</code> implies), they can also have properties, including the automatically updated <code>length</code> property.</li><li>Functions are subtype of objects still <code>typeof</code> returns “function”. There are a lot of built in functions available like <code>toUpperCase();</code> , <code>toFixed();</code> .Clearly I can not state all of them.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Coercion — It is a concept where type casting of variable happens when certain operations are performed with the variable.</p></blockquote><p>var a = “48”;\<br>var b = Number(a); //Normal type casting in JS</p><p>var c = a*1; // Coercion, c is a number variable</p><ul><li>When non boolean values are coerced to boolean then values are often judged as true and false but the question arises which one would be true and which one would be false?</li><li>True: <code>&quot;hello&quot;(non-empty string),23(non zero number),[ ](array empty or filled),{}(object empty or filled),function foo(){___}</code></li><li>False: <code>&quot;&quot;(empty string),0,-0,NaN,null,undefined</code></li></ul><blockquote><p>Equality:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>1, “==” — loose equality</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>2, “===” — strict equality</p></blockquote><p>var a = “42”,b = 42;\<br>a==b;//true\<br>a===b;//false</p><ul><li>We must avoid “==” while comparing with : <code>0,&quot;&quot;,[],true/false,null</code></li><li>Another interesting thing I found in this chapter was comparison of array. Array comparison will always give <code>false</code> .</li><li>Behavior of != and !== is loose and strict respectively. Also inequalities are pretty much basic and is not different from the classic one (&lt;=,&gt;=,&lt;,&gt;).</li></ul><blockquote><p>Now I’ll just write some definitions of some terms. We have dedicated chapters that will cover these topics in depth. So don’t worry if you do not get it in one go.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Hoisting: It is JavaScript’s default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function or scope).</li><li><strong>Polyfiling</strong>: A polyfill is code that implements a feature on web browsers that do not support the feature.</li><li><strong>Transpiling</strong>: Process of reading source code written in one programming language, and producing the equivalent code in another language.</li><li><strong>Prototypes</strong>: When you reference a property on an object, if that property doesn’t exist, JavaScript will automatically use that object’s internal prototype reference to find another object to look for the property on. You could think of this almost as a fallback if the property is missing.</li><li><strong><em>this</em> identifier</strong>: If a function has a <code>this</code> reference inside it, that <code>this</code> reference usually points to an <code>object</code>. But which <code>object</code> it points to depends on how the function was called. It’s important to realize that <code>this</code> <em>does not</em> refer to the function itself, as is the most common misconception.</li><li><strong>Closures:</strong> You can think of closure as a way to “remember” and continue to access a function’s scope (its variables) even once the function has finished running.</li><li><strong>IIFEs:</strong> Immediately Invoked Function Expressions. As the name suggests these gets invoked immediately after function declaration. A common example is settimeout function.</li></ul><p>(function IIFE(){\<br>console.log( “Hello!” );\<br>})();\<br>// “Hello!”</p><ul><li>Modules: Modules let you define private implementation details (variables, functions) that are hidden from the outside world, as well as a public-API that <em>is</em> accessible from the outside.</li><li>use Strict: Its a good programming practice to use this as it refrains you to do logical errors by not allowing you to make global variables.</li></ul><p>I’ve covered most of the part in this chapter. YDKJS up and going also has a chapter 3 but I would not be doing that part as its nothing but introduction to all the book series.</p><p>So thank you for reading it. Follow my coding journey on <a href="https://github.com/chaitanyagiri/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">github</a>. If you are new then follow me on medium.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://www.crsfbay.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/how-to-treat-a-slow-computer.jpg" alt="Frustrated Developer"><br>A month back I was just ready to make my first full-stack application. I had spent a lot of time studying nodeJS, mongoDB, expressJS but it was time to put them all together, making every bit of learning count.</p><p>One fine day one of my senior (who knew I was learning development, I was lucky to have him to back me) approached me and asked me if I can make a web-application for <a href="https://github.com/Cybros" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cybros</a> (A computer club in our college). I immediately knew this was my opportunity so I accepted the offer.</p><p>The problem: Cybros organizes lectures, talks, meet ups, classes, workshops, competitions and what not so we have to use 3rd party applications to create events and register users.</p><p>Solution: I created an application in which admin can create,update,delete events and user can browse and register in events.</p><hr><p>Here are some common difficulties that I think most of you will face while developing your first full-stack application:</p><ul><li><strong>Designing the structure of the entire application</strong></li></ul><p>I particularly found it hard as I was just said to make one application with a very vague idea and no requirement list so I had to think of problem then come up with optimal solution and design accordingly.</p><ul><li><strong>Using other dependencies</strong></li></ul><p>When I started the project I knew about some modules that could have been of great help but I decided not to use them as I will not learn anything more from it. So it took me a while to figure out how to do this and how to do that.</p><ul><li><strong>Bugs due to testing application on one browser only</strong></li></ul><p>I used to test the application only on Mozilla Firefox. So I faced a lot of issues of improper UI and no responsiveness of web application. So make sure you test your website on multiple browsers.</p><ul><li><strong>You alone won’t find all of the bugs by yourself.</strong></li></ul><p>My friends came to my rescue. I used to show changes that I made to my friends regularly, so they used to try all set of permutations and combinations and find something buggy in the application.</p><ul><li><strong>You will push something stupid to the main branch of the code-base</strong></li></ul><p>I accidentally pushed buggy version in the master branch. As the project was gaining popularity and more and more people were contributing to project.(Yes, the project was open source but most of the work was done by me most of the other contributors were responsible for UI changes) People immediately started creating issues that application is not working. So make sure you have someone to review your changes.</p><hr><p>Now that a beta version of application is ready you can find it <a href="https://github.com/Cybros/Cybros-Web-Application" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and I will now learn REACT, start my own new project. Follow my journey on <a href="https://github.com/chaitanyagiri" target="_blank" rel="noopener">github</a>.</p>]]></content>

Here’s some reason why you should attend one:</p><ul><li><strong>Awesome people around you :</strong> You get to meet a lot of inspirational people, you will find yourself around a lot of people having similar interests.</li><li><strong>Get to know about new technologies</strong> : New technologies is what fascinates every developer, I especially enjoyed that part of the event you will get to know about new languages, frameworks, have an hands on experience with some languages or technology.</li><li><strong>Discover yourself</strong> <strong>:</strong> You will be able to see where you stand among your peers. This will help you to get a direction wherever you will proceed in your career.</li><li><strong>Awesome goodies</strong> : I got an awesome T-shirt and some cool goodies so even if you are a complete beginner at least you get these stuffs.</li><li><strong>Awesome food</strong> : If you are lucky enough, some of these events have lunch and often conducted in a reputed place. So you will find a way to satisfy your tummies as well.</li><li><strong>Opportunities</strong> : Since so much networking happens in GDG DevFests so there is a high probably that you bag an opportunity for yourself. (Pro tip: Get in touch with the organizers.)</li></ul><p>This will be a wonderful experience as whole, you will definitely learn a lot from an event like this, so in future if you get an opportunity don’t miss out, do attend GDG DevFests. Happy Coding.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi there, I am Starting this blog series in which I would be summarizing: <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You Don’t Know JavaScript</a>.<br>I will try to write a chapter’s summary at a time, please correct me<br>where I am wrong I’d love to have a healthy discussion over JavaScript<br>with you, follow up for further updates.</p><p><img src="https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41L18FvA5rL.jpg" alt="Up and Going"></p><p>Summarizing YDKJS UP and GOING</p><p>YDKJS is a book series and it contains 6 books:</p><ul><li>UP &amp;GOING</li><li>SCOPE &amp; CLOSURES</li><li>this &amp; OBJECT PROTOTYPES</li><li>TYPES &amp; GRAMMAR</li><li>ASYNC &amp; PERFORMANCE</li><li>ES6 AND BEYOND</li></ul><p><strong>Note:<br>This summary is not for complete newbie its for someone who has done<br>some coding previously or is familiar with JS. However if you find the<br>summary comfortable you can go for it.</strong></p><p>YDKJS-&gt; UP &amp; GOING-&gt;Chapter-1:</p><p>A code is divided into two subgroups:</p><ol><li>Statement: Group of words, numbers, and operators that performs a specific task. Consists of one or more than one expressions. <strong>Most </strong>statements end with a ‘ _;_ ’.</li><li>Expressions: Set of variable(s) and value(s) combined with operators.</li></ol><p>Explaining <em>a = b * 2;</em> (complete statement contains 4 expressions):</p><p>1, _2_-literal exp</p><p>2, _b_-variable exp</p><p>3, <em>b*2</em>-arithmetic exp</p><p>4, <em>a=b*2</em>-assignment exp</p><p>Then it recommends you to use developer console of your browser. Open a new tab and type _about:blank _in address bar and then open developer’s console from settings (or press <em>Ctrl+shift+I</em> in Google chrome or <em>Ctrl+shift+K</em> in Mozilla Firefox). For multi line code press <em>shift+Enter</em> to get to new line and press <em>Enter</em> to run code. Now try below code in your console.</p><p>anything you want to display in console must be inside the _console.log( ); _statement. You may try using _alert(b); _after the code and see that there is an alert box on the top of browser. We won’t use _alert(); _in YDKJS.</p><p>To get some input from user we will use _prompt(); <em>try replacing</em> a=21; _by_ a=prompt(“Enter value of a:”);_</p><p>Operators- We perform actions on variables and values through operators. Some common type of operators are:</p><ul><li>=(assignment)</li><li><em>+, -, *, /</em>(math)</li><li>+=, -=, *=, and /=(compound assignment)</li><li>++ (increment), – (decrement)</li><li>Object Property Access-(.)</li><li>Equality: == , === , != ,!==</li><li>Comparison:&lt;,&gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=</li><li>Logical:&amp;&amp;(and),||(or)</li></ul><p>There are 6 total data types in JS :String, Number, Boolean, null and undefined, object, symbol(new in ES6).There is a _typeof (anyValue); _operator which tells you the data type of given value. <em>typeof (null); returns us “object” possibly a bug.</em></p><p>Commenting your code is a good programming practice:</p><ul><li>// This is a single-line comment</li><li>/<em> But this is<br>a multiline<br>comment. </em>/</li></ul><p>Variable: Symbolic container. The value in this container can <em>vary</em> over time as needed. Definition: <em>var a= “This is a sample variable”;</em></p><p>_var a = “42”;/<em>string</em>/ <em>and</em> var b= 42; /<em>Number</em>/_ are different. Use <em>Number(a); and String(b);</em> to change their data types;</p><p>Block: Wrapping one or more statements inside a curly-brace pair</p><p><em>{ .. }</em></p><p>Conditionals: Most common one is _if(Condition){statement(s);} <em>means</em> If_ this condition is true, do the following.</p><p><em>if(10&lt;20){console.log(“10 is smaller than 20”);}</em></p><p><em>else{console.log(“10 is greater than 20”)}</em></p><p>_If_ this 10&lt;20, do the this, else do that.</p><p>Loops:3 types : 1,for() 2,while() 3,do{}while()</p><p>for():</p><p>for (var i = 0; i &lt;= 9; i = i + 1) {<br>console.log( i );<br>}<br>// 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</p><p>while():</p><p>var i = 0;</p><p>// a <code>while..true</code> loop would run forever, right?<br>while (true) {<br>// stop the loop?<br>if ((i &lt;= 9) === false) {<br>break;<br>}</p><pre><code>console.log( i );  i = i + 1;  </code></pre><p>}<br>// 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</p><p>do{}while():</p><p>do {<br>console.log( “How may I help you?” );</p><pre><code>// help the customer...  numOfCustomers = numOfCustomers - 1;  </code></pre><p>} while (numOfCustomers &gt; 0);</p><p>Functions:<br>A named section of code that can be “called” by name, and the code<br>inside it will be run each time. Functions can optionally take arguments<br>(aka parameters).</p><p>Definition: <em>function anyName(parameters separated by comma if you want){statement(s);}</em></p><p>Scope:<br>scope/lexical scope rules say that code in one scope can access<br>variables of either that scope or any scope outside of it.</p><p>Consider:</p><p>function outer() {<br>var a = 1;</p><pre><code>function inner() {      var b = 2;    // we can access both `a` and `b` here      console.log( a + b );    // 3  }inner();// we can only access `a` here  console.log( a );            // 1  </code></pre><p>}</p><p>outer();</p><p>We have detailed 3 chapters in another book of this series on scope and closures.</p><p>I<br>didn’t wanted it to be this long but since it was more of an<br>introduction so be it I assure next summaries will be shorter and<br>concise.
