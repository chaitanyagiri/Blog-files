There has been a lot of buzz for data science among the developer community. But some questions do arise when it comes to practical impacts that it has produced over these years or will produce in the coming years.</p><h4 id="So-what-is-Data-Science"><a href="#So-what-is-Data-Science" class="headerlink" title="So, what is Data Science?"></a>So, what is Data Science?</h4><blockquote><p>In God we trust, all others must bring data.- William Edwards Deming</p></blockquote><p>The Internet is responsible to produce enormous amount of data since its origin. It carries information about various users, their Internet usage, their search queries and what not. These data when used properly, it can predict great things with greater accuracy.</p><p>So, data science deals with the process that involves extraction of valuable results, observations and insights from these data.</p><h4 id="Is-it-worth-so-much-discussion"><a href="#Is-it-worth-so-much-discussion" class="headerlink" title="Is it worth so much discussion?"></a>Is it worth so much discussion?</h4><p>Remember the predictions that we discussed above. Now suppose you are able to predict what your user is interested in buying just by seeing his search queries from the week, now you are able to put relevant ads for every user. Suppose you are able to guess the stability in the stock market just by going through previous stock prices. Suppose you are able to predict some natural calamity before it happens just by looking at previous data of natural disasters. These all are among those infinitely many crucial things that can impact you and industries around you directly.</p><h4 id="It’s-impact-in-industries"><a href="#It’s-impact-in-industries" class="headerlink" title="It’s impact in industries."></a>It’s impact in industries.</h4><p>Data is no more just data it has become a powerful tool to leverage your company in many aspects like:</p><ul><li><strong>Marketing</strong> — With proper implementation of data science, a company now knows what type of advertisements should be shown to what type of users/potential users. Also maintaining them is easier than ever.</li><li><strong>Product</strong> — A product can now be tested and automated through available datasets of real world users. Now companies are less prone to bugs that’ll cost them millions of dollars if not found.</li><li><strong>Sales</strong> —Finding the perfect audience is a major factor to increase the revenues of any organization. Analyzing the data about previous customer transactions, about the product in demand, the demographics of the customers etc. could help identify who to target on.</li><li><strong>User-End Applications</strong> — A decent amount of companies providing solutions to many data science related problem have emerged in recent times. These companies not only increase the usage of data analytics and data science but also help the community of people who want to have their career in this field.</li><li><strong>Automation</strong> — Different industries have felt the data science revolution by observing the sudden increase in automation. Many repetitive, complex jobs that required labor are now automated. While it’s very less likely to happen that AI/automation will take over most of the jobs but this surely has led to increase in unemployment.</li></ul><p>Data Science has opened many doors for industries in many fields like health-care, agriculture, education etc. It has made the much-needed impact that has not been made in the industries for years. This is surely a boon for our society</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since medium tells me that I have some international readers so I thought that I should explain Indian reservation system to them. Indians(protesters) who claim to already know about it might also want to consider reading it.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/716/1*bIErugBlKZ7zApV4Rlfy6g.jpeg" alt=""></p><p><a href="http://writm.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://writm.com</a></p><p>Indian reservation system was started way before independence (Search for British influence in India) by Maharajah of Kolhapur in 1891(supposedly) in his own reign. His 1902 measures created 50 per cent reservation for backward communities.</p><p><strong>Q. Was reservation even required back then?</strong></p><p><strong>A.</strong> YES! in fact, you can’t even imagine the condition of people back then. Despite all the good things that Indian civilization possessed it had some major drawbacks, for example, Sati Pratha, Untouchability etc. While Indians were already getting harassed by Britishers the backward community’s condition was even worse some so-called upper caste people of India used their superiority in the community to harass the backward communities.</p><p><strong>Q</strong>. <strong>What are these backward communities and how they were formed?</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>. The place where I come from backward communities were usually those people who were not able to keep up with the changes in the world or better say did not have opportunities/facilities like other people. Indian caste system classified the society in principle into four varnas(types):</p><p>1, Brahmin- priests, scholars and teachers.\<br>2, Kshatriya- rulers, warriors and administrators.\<br>3, Vaishya- agriculturalists and merchants.\<br>4, Shudra- labourers and service providers.</p><p>Apart from these types, the unclassified ones were called avarna most of the people who have reservation nowadays belong to this category. While it may look like it is been a discriminative classification but the people who were responsible for this were the most genius brains at that time and even now. This system was robust, every part of the society had equal importance and every part of society was required to work efficiently for a community to grow.</p><p>But the influence of other civilizations like Mughals, Europeans and British made it the way it is now. There was indeed a loophole in the Indian caste system. <strong><em>Now instead of classifying people on the basis of the work they do they were classified on the basis of caste they were born in.</em></strong></p><p>Presently reservation in India exists in employment, education and elected bodies.</p><p><strong>Q. Is reservation required now?</strong></p><p><strong>A.</strong> YES! I have seen people living in worst conditions only if they had proper education, and better opportunities their lifestyles would be way better than now. But as said by many global thinkers Indian reservation system needs some serious reforms. Now, remember the caste-based system which already had loopholes, the people who drafted the Indian Constitution<strong>(I don’t think that’s just one person to be credited or blamed for this)</strong> forgot about the loophole and again took the same cast based system as a foundation to define new reservation system.</p><p>PS- I am a peace loving person. I take stand on what I said and these are my views I do not want to hurt any sentiments and please don’t kill me for this.</p>]]></content>

Every now and then we suffer data loss and this can be crucial when it comes to huge data that are essential for a company to even <strong>exist.</strong> Suppose next day you wakeup and open amazon to buy something and you do not find a single product 😆. Now this is very less likely to happen because we have replica set. (Note: Amazon do not use mongodb to store data this was an example, though they use a NoSQL database so it has to be something similar).</p><p>Replica set has been in mongodb for a while now, previously instead of replica set we had master-slave replication(Please refer some other article if you want to learn about this).</p><h3 id="How-does-it-work"><a href="#How-does-it-work" class="headerlink" title="How does it work?"></a>How does it work?</h3><p>Basically a replica set is multiple set of mongod instances that hosts same data(this can be tricky to say as in any instance some data might be put after some delay but for the moment let’s assume as it is).</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*4m_iWLMgg7W3cu0mYjUNsw.jpeg" alt=""></p><p>MongoDB replica set</p><p>Now assume we have a primary node that has multiple secondary nodes(max 50) say 2 in this case. When ever client writes or reads from primary node the primary node logs it in its oplog. Now the two secondary nodes replicate the oplog’s operations and in-turn has the same data as primary. Now this nodes are connected with the primary node with a heartbeat kind of structure in if the primary node does not reply to their heartbeats in 10 seconds. Secondary nodes do an election sort of thing to replace primary node(😢 So rude). Now if there are less than 7 secondary nodes and total number of secondary node is even then there is an extra node called <strong>Arbiter</strong> it do not replicates it simply participate in election so that in the election a draw among nodes never happens and if there are 7 or more nodes then any 7 will participate based on their priority value(more details ahead).</p><p>Secondary nodes also have a priority value attached to them which helps in election. The extract of this statement can be: If a node has priority value 0 then it will never be elected and it’ll always have the data with it so it provides an extra layer of security to data loss.(Amazon is safe 😆).</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*tDU3bK4zNcQDXP3TSDPKwA.jpeg" alt=""></p><p>MongoDB replica and arbiter</p><h3 id="Now-how-can-you-actually-setup-a-replica-set-in-MongoDB"><a href="#Now-how-can-you-actually-setup-a-replica-set-in-MongoDB" class="headerlink" title="Now how can you actually setup a replica set in MongoDB?"></a>Now how can you actually setup a replica set in MongoDB?</h3><ul><li>By default, MongoDB bind to local interface only, it will restrict the remote connections.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So first of all <strong>yay! 😄 😄</strong> I mentored pre-university students in <a href="https://codein.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Code-In’17</a>, I am so happy that I can’t even describe the feeling.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/716/1*dTEKWMpmzODJufrMh_7OMg.png" alt=""></p><p>See that blue picture of me. 😃</p><p>So, November was the month when it all started. I was preparing for the end term examinations, I wasn’t doing much of any other work as I need to focus on my grades (😜 they are a bit on the lower side).</p><p>One day I came across an article about GCI(<a href="https://codein.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Code-In</a>). I thought I must apply to be a part of this(Though didn’t expect to get selected).</p><p>Here are some points explaining the application procedure:</p><ul><li>Wait for next GCI to start.(Obviously 😜)</li><li>Each year different organizations are selected to be a part of GCI. You can easily see them <a href="https://codein.withgoogle.com/organizations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</li><li>Now next thing you need to do to apply as a mentor is get the mailing details or any type of communication platform that the organization prefers.</li><li>Introduce and simply ask how to join the community as a mentor for GCI. They’ll guide you.</li><li>You’ll be asked to describe yourself and show that you are worthy of being a mentor. Just simply tell them about the projects you have done, show them your Github profile(You need to be active on Github),your preferred tech-stack, tell them about your experience on different projects etc.Now, this step differs from organization to organization but the idea behind that remains the same.</li></ul><p>My experience with GCI was amazing, our organization was among the top organizations in terms of completed tasks( 😜 Though its not a competition among organizations still whats good is good). I interacted with more than 50 students from different countries all around the world, helped them in various domains like coding, designing, writing etc. Some of the students needed more help so even had to spend hours with the single student but at the end I saw it as an opportunity to give back to the community which has helped me learn so many things. I am grateful to <a href="https://medium.com/@KeenWarrior" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anuj Garg</a> (somehow found you on Medium 😄) and <a href="http://www.jboss.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JBOSS</a> for giving me the opportunity to do so.</p><p>To know more about my journey follow me on <a href="https://medium.com/@chaitanyagiri" target="_blank" rel="noopener">medium</a>, <a href="https://github.com/chaitanyagiri" target="_blank" rel="noopener">github</a>.</p><p>Happy Coding 😃</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A Hackathon is a 24/48 hours competition in which you come up with an idea and a product(prototype). If you haven’t attended any hackathon yet let me tell you this thing you are missing out a whole lot of cool stuff.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*JKP-l7HSzSpFZsyUUEmgug.png" alt=""></p><p>GitHub Octopotter for SAF-AI</p><p>So when I came to know that a hackathon is going to happen at our university. I was so excited and could not wait and went ahead to form a team. Since certain tracks were made available so I kind of knew what kind of product we were going to make. So accordingly I approached a guy who was learning about machine learning and stuff so he (Vibhas Bhairav Singh) became the second member of our team. Then we needed a person with amazing graphic designing skills so that our product does not suck at least visually. So we approached one of our junior batch guy(Samyak) as he was a good designer and was not been approached by anyone yet.\<br>So I was responsible for the platform, Vibhas for machine learning and Samyak for designing.\<br>We were ready and then in some days, we started brainstorming ideas so we came up with the idea of SAF-AI. It was our product for the hackathon let me introduce you what <a href="https://github.com/saf-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><em>SAF-AI</em></strong></a> is and how we created it.</p><h3 id="SAF-AI"><a href="#SAF-AI" class="headerlink" title="SAF-AI"></a><a href="https://github.com/saf-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAF-AI</a></h3><ul><li>As​ ​per​ ​a​ ​2013​ ​report​ ​from​ ​the​ ​International​ ​Solid​ ​Waste​ ​Association​ ​(ISWA), ​only​ ​73.9​ ​percent​ ​of garbage​ ​generated​ ​is​ ​collected.​ ​That​ ​still​ ​looks​ ​like​ ​a​ ​good​ ​number.​ ​Isn’t​ ​it?​ ​Here’s​ ​a​ ​figure 1,840,000,000,000.​ ​This​ ​is​ ​the​ ​amount​ ​of​ ​waste​ ​generated​ ​in​ ​2013​ ​in​ ​kilograms​ ​and​ ​hence\<br>478,400,000,000​ ​kgs​ ​of​ ​waste​ ​were​ ​not​ ​even​ ​collected.​ ​This​ ​was​ ​stats​ ​from​ ​2013​ ​and​ ​over​ ​all​ ​these years​ ​it​ ​has​ ​become​ ​even​ ​worse. So​ ​all​ ​these​ ​years​ ​have​ ​passed,​ ​lots​ ​and​ ​lots​ ​of​ ​technology​ ​advancement​ ​happened​ ​but​ ​still, ​we​ ​can’t even​ ​locate​ ​garbage​ ​in​ ​our​ ​locality.</li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*-RtuU3M_WWg6BstfZBAPTw.png" alt=""></p><p>Logo SAF-AI</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/saf-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SAF-AI</strong></a> is a web application that provides a platform for people all around the world to locate garbage and its severity level in their locality not only this the data provided goes to our server and our ML algorithm clusters data and then finds the shortest path from the locations for the garbage truck to travel upon so that we can now not only locate garbage but also provide an efficient way to collect it.</li></ul><h3 id="Something-bad-happened"><a href="#Something-bad-happened" class="headerlink" title="Something bad happened"></a>Something bad happened</h3><ul><li>So we were struggling with the algorithm part of the application. we spent about 6 hours figuring out how to implement Dijkstra’s algorithm over our collected dataset.

But after getting rejected we all went to sleep. When we woke up and some of my friends asked me to show my project I opened the database and boom it was empty. Not a single response. If the judges have opened the application we would have got some data in our database. People were trying to buck me up but yeah I was depressed for the fact that we did not even get evaluated for some silly mistake.</li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DuQCQi3tdPQv2gSdiw8kgw.png" alt=""></p><p>Laptop mockup</p><h3 id="Something-good-happened"><a href="#Something-good-happened" class="headerlink" title="Something good happened"></a>Something good happened</h3><blockquote><p>So, believe it or not, life’s a<strong>it won’t let a single of </strong>mistake<strong> go uncounted and it won’t let a single of your </strong>effort** go in vain.</p></blockquote><ul><li>I came across another bigger hackathon where you have to present your idea and they select you to come to their place and then make the product there.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/716/1*S6WRdAHcg-wLeXEHP0KcZw.jpeg" alt=""></p><p>Image via: ebs.ie</p><p>I write mostly about tech. So whats the need to even think out of context. Trust me I won’t, if situation would not have been this serious. I may get some ** feminist comments but I think its worth taking a risk.</p><p>Do you know what day was celebrated yesterday? Come on make a guess? Most of you might have already guessed it as the heading says it all (<em>FacePalm</em>). Let me tell you yesterday was International Men’s Day.</p><p>I usually don’t mind much about dates(the ones in calendar of-course 😜 ). But I always believe statistics can tell a lot. So I have a habit of using <a href="http://trends.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google trends</a> I observe and analyze data to produce useful and amazing(sometimes shocking) results. So I was going through it and found plenty of things to worry about:</p><p>1, It showed “International Men’s day” was searched 15 times more on March than on November. Fun fact: International Men’s day is celebrated on 19th November and International Women’s day on 8th March. People are so ignorant that they tend to search about “Men’s day” on Women’s day rather than on Men’s day.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/716/1*KxcSj8fbbcW31LmcRASylQ.png" alt=""></p><p>See the peak in March.</p><p>Women’s Day = 1, Men’s Day = 0.</p><p>2, So I went ahead and continued this interesting research a bit to find out that comparing query searches of “International Men’s Day” and “International Women’s Day” was even worse.(Google-Trends converts its data in percentage automatically.) Percentage of people who searched for “Men’s Day” was close to ZERO (0) while percentage of people who searched for “Women’s Day” was close to 100 annually.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/716/1*tU3zk_VlEPhJKYfY7yELJQ.png" alt=""></p><p>Red = International Women’s Day ; Blue = International Men’s Day</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/716/1*daxYP1prnktx4frzo9WI_Q.png" alt=""></p><p><strong><strong>__</strong></strong>Red = “International Women’s Day” searches more than “International men’s day” searches. <strong><strong>__</strong></strong>Blue = “International Men’s Day” searches more than “International women’s day” searches.</p><p>Women’s Day = 2, Men’s Day = 0.</p><p>3, Now this one is actually funny as well as shocking. People actually searched for “Is there an International Men’s Day”. Really, who ever did that must be having an existential crisis.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/716/1*mpzB9JUoUKHmITkIhOQiKw.png" alt=""></p><p>Look in related query section.</p><p>Women’s Day = 3, Men’s Day = -1 (People searched “Is there an International Men’s Day”)</p><p>These are not merely stats, these are the reflection of what world has become. Instead of promoting equality among genders and implementing practical solutions people are hyping topics people are using terms like “feminism” to grind their own axes.</p><p>So what happened here is people have hyped this thing so much that it don’t even feel like equality. It feels like it has been burdened upon us. We must understand at the end of the day terms do not matter what matters is the intentions.</p><p>Feel free to share this and comment to discuss more about it.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here, enjoy this song while reading the story: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBumgq5yVrA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Let her go</a>. (No they didn’t paid me). Click <a href="https://medium.com/@16ucc028/summarizing-ydkjs-up-going-chapter-1-5efff3096483" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> to read summary of UP &amp; GOING chapter 1.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*JOw6-O9fPWSV8O1oSfzfGg.jpeg" alt=""></p><p>YDKJS Up and Going</p><hr><p>So, the heading of this chapter is “<a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20%26%20going/ch2.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Into JavaScript</a>“. This really takes you a bit deeper <strong><em>into</em></strong> JavaScript learning.</p><ul><li>Recall that there are 6 type of variables: String, Number, Boolean, null and undefined, object, symbol as already mentioned in previous story.</li></ul><blockquote><p>The <code>object</code> type refers to a compound value where you can set properties (named locations) that each hold their own values of any type. This is perhaps one of the most useful value types in all of JavaScript.</p></blockquote><p>var obj = {\<br>a: “hello world”,\<br>b: 42,\<br>c: function foo(){ console.log(“Hello World”)}\<br>/<em>YES EVEN THAT\<br>IS POSSIBLE</em>/\<br>};\<br>obj.a;//hello world\<br>obj[“b”];//42</p><blockquote><p>An array is an <code>object</code> that holds values (of any type) not particularly in named properties/keys, but rather in numerically indexed positions. For example:</p></blockquote><p>var arr = [\<br>“hello world”,\<br>42,\<br>true\<br>];</p><p>arr[0]; //hello world</p><ul><li>arrays are special objects (as <code>typeof</code> implies), they can also have properties, including the automatically updated <code>length</code> property.</li><li>Functions are subtype of objects still <code>typeof</code> returns “function”. There are a lot of built in functions available like <code>toUpperCase();</code> , <code>toFixed();</code> .Clearly I can not state all of them.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Coercion — It is a concept where type casting of variable happens when certain operations are performed with the variable.</p></blockquote><p>var a = “48”;\<br>var b = Number(a); //Normal type casting in JS</p><p>var c = a*1; // Coercion, c is a number variable</p><ul><li>When non boolean values are coerced to boolean then values are often judged as true and false but the question arises which one would be true and which one would be false?</li><li>True: <code>&quot;hello&quot;(non-empty string),23(non zero number),[ ](array empty or filled),{}(object empty or filled),function foo(){___}</code></li><li>False: <code>&quot;&quot;(empty string),0,-0,NaN,null,undefined</code></li></ul><blockquote><p>Equality:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>1, “==” — loose equality</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>2, “===” — strict equality</p></blockquote><p>var a = “42”,b = 42;\<br>a==b;//true\<br>a===b;//false</p><ul><li>We must avoid “==” while comparing with : <code>0,&quot;&quot;,[],true/false,null</code></li><li>Another interesting thing I found in this chapter was comparison of array. Array comparison will always give <code>false</code> .</li><li>Behavior of != and !== is loose and strict respectively. Also inequalities are pretty much basic and is not different from the classic one (&lt;=,&gt;=,&lt;,&gt;).</li></ul><blockquote><p>Now I’ll just write some definitions of some terms. We have dedicated chapters that will cover these topics in depth. So don’t worry if you do not get it in one go.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Hoisting: It is JavaScript’s default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function or scope).</li><li><strong>Polyfiling</strong>: A polyfill is code that implements a feature on web browsers that do not support the feature.</li><li><strong>Transpiling</strong>: Process of reading source code written in one programming language, and producing the equivalent code in another language.</li><li><strong>Prototypes</strong>: When you reference a property on an object, if that property doesn’t exist, JavaScript will automatically use that object’s internal prototype reference to find another object to look for the property on. You could think of this almost as a fallback if the property is missing.</li><li><strong><em>this</em> identifier</strong>: If a function has a <code>this</code> reference inside it, that <code>this</code> reference usually points to an <code>object</code>. But which <code>object</code> it points to depends on how the function was called. It’s important to realize that <code>this</code> <em>does not</em> refer to the function itself, as is the most common misconception.</li><li><strong>Closures:</strong> You can think of closure as a way to “remember” and continue to access a function’s scope (its variables) even once the function has finished running.</li><li><strong>IIFEs:</strong> Immediately Invoked Function Expressions. As the name suggests these gets invoked immediately after function declaration. A common example is settimeout function.</li></ul><p>(function IIFE(){\<br>console.log( “Hello!” );\<br>})();\<br>// “Hello!”</p><ul><li>Modules: Modules let you define private implementation details (variables, functions) that are hidden from the outside world, as well as a public-API that <em>is</em> accessible from the outside.</li><li>use Strict: Its a good programming practice to use this as it refrains you to do logical errors by not allowing you to make global variables.</li></ul><p>I’ve covered most of the part in this chapter. YDKJS up and going also has a chapter 3 but I would not be doing that part as its nothing but introduction to all the book series.</p><p>So thank you for reading it.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://www.crsfbay.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/how-to-treat-a-slow-computer.jpg" alt="Frustrated Developer"><br>A month back I was just ready to make my first full-stack application. I had spent a lot of time studying nodeJS, mongoDB, expressJS but it was time to put them all together, making every bit of learning count.</p><p>One fine day one of my senior (who knew I was learning development, I was lucky to have him to back me) approached me and asked me if I can make a web-application for <a href="https://github.com/Cybros" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cybros</a> (A computer club in our college). I immediately knew this was my opportunity so I accepted the offer.</p><p>The problem: Cybros organizes lectures, talks, meet ups, classes, workshops, competitions and what not so we have to use 3rd party applications to create events and register users.</p><p>Solution: I created an application in which admin can create,update,delete events and user can browse and register in events.</p><hr><p>Here are some common difficulties that I think most of you will face while developing your first full-stack application:</p><ul><li><strong>Designing the structure of the entire application</strong></li></ul><p>I particularly found it hard as I was just said to make one application with a very vague idea and no requirement list so I had to think of problem then come up with optimal solution and design accordingly.</p><ul><li><strong>Using other dependencies</strong></li></ul><p>When I started the project I knew about some modules that could have been of great help but I decided not to use them as I will not learn anything more from it. So it took me a while to figure out how to do this and how to do that.</p><ul><li><strong>Bugs due to testing application on one browser only</strong></li></ul><p>I used to test the application only on Mozilla Firefox. So I faced a lot of issues of improper UI and no responsiveness of web application. So make sure you test your website on multiple browsers.</p><ul><li><strong>You alone won’t find all of the bugs by yourself.</strong></li></ul><p>My friends came to my rescue. I used to show changes that I made to my friends regularly, so they used to try all set of permutations and combinations and find something buggy in the application.</p><ul><li><strong>You will push something stupid to the main branch of the code-base</strong></li></ul><p>I accidentally pushed buggy version in the master branch. As the project was gaining popularity and more and more people were contributing to project.(Yes, the project was open source but most of the work was done by me most of the other contributors were responsible for UI changes) People immediately started creating issues that application is not working. So make sure you have someone to review your changes.</p><hr><p>Now that a beta version of application is ready you can find it <a href="https://github.com/Cybros/Cybros-Web-Application" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and I will now learn REACT, start my own new project. Follow my journey on <a href="https://github.com/chaitanyagiri" target="_blank" rel="noopener">github</a>.</p>]]></content>

Here’s some reason why you should attend one:</p><ul><li><strong>Awesome people around you :</strong> You get to meet a lot of inspirational people, you will find yourself around a lot of people having similar interests.</li><li><strong>Get to know about new technologies</strong> : New technologies is what fascinates every developer, I especially enjoyed that part of the event you will get to know about new languages, frameworks, have an hands on experience with some languages or technology.</li><li><strong>Discover yourself</strong> <strong>:</strong> You will be able to see where you stand among your peers. This will help you to get a direction wherever you will proceed in your career.</li><li><strong>Awesome goodies</strong> : I got an awesome T-shirt and some cool goodies so even if you are a complete beginner at least you get these stuffs.</li><li><strong>Awesome food</strong> : If you are lucky enough, some of these events have lunch and often conducted in a reputed place. So you will find a way to satisfy your tummies as well.</li><li><strong>Opportunities</strong> : Since so much networking happens in GDG DevFests so there is a high probably that you bag an opportunity for yourself. (Pro tip: Get in touch with the organizers.)</li></ul><p>This will be a wonderful experience as whole, you will definitely learn a lot from an event like this, so in future if you get an opportunity don’t miss out, do attend GDG DevFests. Happy Coding.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi there, I am Starting this blog series in which I would be summarizing: <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You Don’t Know JavaScript</a>.<br>I will try to write a chapter’s summary at a time, please correct me<br>where I am wrong I’d love to have a healthy discussion over JavaScript<br>with you, follow up for further updates.</p><p><img src="https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41L18FvA5rL.jpg" alt="Up and Going"></p><p>Summarizing YDKJS UP and GOING</p><p>YDKJS is a book series and it contains 6 books:</p><ul><li>UP &amp;GOING</li><li>SCOPE &amp; CLOSURES</li><li>this &amp; OBJECT PROTOTYPES</li><li>TYPES &amp; GRAMMAR</li><li>ASYNC &amp; PERFORMANCE</li><li>ES6 AND BEYOND</li></ul><p><strong>Note:<br>This summary is not for complete newbie its for someone who has done<br>some coding previously or is familiar with JS. However if you find the<br>summary comfortable you can go for it.</strong></p><p>YDKJS-&gt; UP &amp; GOING-&gt;Chapter-1:</p><p>A code is divided into two subgroups:</p><ol><li>Statement: Group of words, numbers, and operators that performs a specific task. Consists of one or more than one expressions. <strong>Most </strong>statements end with a ‘ _;_ ’.</li><li>Expressions: Set of variable(s) and value(s) combined with operators.</li></ol><p>Explaining <em>a = b * 2;</em> (complete statement contains 4 expressions):</p><p>1, _2_-literal exp</p><p>2, _b_-variable exp</p><p>3, <em>b*2</em>-arithmetic exp</p><p>4, <em>a=b*2</em>-assignment exp</p><p>Then it recommends you to use developer console of your browser. Open a new tab and type _about:blank _in address bar and then open developer’s console from settings (or press <em>Ctrl+shift+I</em> in Google chrome or <em>Ctrl+shift+K</em> in Mozilla Firefox). For multi line code press <em>shift+Enter</em> to get to new line and press <em>Enter</em> to run code. Now try below code in your console.</p><p>anything you want to display in console must be inside the _console.log( ); _statement. You may try using _alert(b); _after the code and see that there is an alert box on the top of browser. We won’t use _alert(); _in YDKJS.</p><p>To get some input from user we will use _prompt(); <em>try replacing</em> a=21; _by_ a=prompt(“Enter value of a:”);_</p><p>Operators- We perform actions on variables and values through operators. Some common type of operators are:</p><ul><li>=(assignment)</li><li><em>+, -, *, /</em>(math)</li><li>+=, -=, *=, and /=(compound assignment)</li><li>++ (increment), – (decrement)</li><li>Object Property Access-(.)</li><li>Equality: == , === , != ,!==</li><li>Comparison:&lt;,&gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=</li><li>Logical:&amp;&amp;(and),||(or)</li></ul><p>There are 6 total data types in JS :String, Number, Boolean, null and undefined, object, symbol(new in ES6).There is a _typeof (anyValue); _operator which tells you the data type of given value. <em>typeof (null); returns us “object” possibly a bug.</em></p><p>Commenting your code is a good programming practice:</p><ul><li>// This is a single-line comment</li><li>/<em> But this is<br>a multiline<br>comment. </em>/</li></ul><p>Variable: Symbolic container. The value in this container can <em>vary</em> over time as needed. Definition: <em>var a= “This is a sample variable”;</em></p><p>_var a = “42”;/<em>string</em>/ <em>and</em> var b= 42; /<em>Number</em>/_ are different. Use <em>Number(a); and String(b);</em> to change their data types;</p><p>Block: Wrapping one or more statements inside a curly-brace pair</p><p><em>{ .. }</em></p><p>Conditionals: Most common one is _if(Condition){statement(s);} <em>means</em> If_ this condition is true, do the following.</p><p><em>if(10&lt;20){console.log(“10 is smaller than 20”);}</em></p><p><em>else{console.log(“10 is greater than 20”)}</em></p><p>_If_ this 10&lt;20, do the this, else do that.</p><p>Loops:3 types : 1,for() 2,while() 3,do{}while()</p><p>for():</p><p>for (var i = 0; i &lt;= 9; i = i + 1) {<br>console.log( i );<br>}<br>// 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</p><p>while():</p><p>var i = 0;</p><p>// a <code>while..true</code> loop would run forever, right?<br>while (true) {<br>// stop the loop?<br>if ((i &lt;= 9) === false) {<br>break;<br>}</p><pre><code>console.log( i );  i = i + 1;  </code></pre><p>}<br>// 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</p><p>do{}while():</p><p>do {<br>console.log( “How may I help you?” );</p><pre><code>// help the customer...  numOfCustomers = numOfCustomers - 1;  </code></pre><p>} while (numOfCustomers &gt; 0);</p><p>Functions:<br>A named section of code that can be “called” by name, and the code<br>inside it will be run each time. Functions can optionally take arguments<br>(aka parameters).</p><p>Definition: <em>function anyName(parameters separated by comma if you want){statement(s);}</em></p><p>Scope:<br>scope/lexical scope rules say that code in one scope can access<br>variables of either that scope or any scope outside of it.</p><p>Consider:</p><p>function outer() {<br>var a = 1;</p><pre><code>function inner() {      var b = 2;    // we can access both `a` and `b` here      console.log( a + b );    // 3  }inner();// we can only access `a` here  console.log( a );            // 1  </code></pre><p>}</p><p>outer();</p><p>We have detailed 3 chapters in another book of this series on scope and closures.</p><p>I<br>didn’t wanted it to be this long but since it was more of an<br>introduction so be it I assure next summaries will be shorter and<br>concise.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started my free code camp in first week of May 2017 and completed it today i.e, 19 June 2017. Here is the link to my <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/chaitanyagiri/front-end-certification" target="_blank" rel="noopener">certificate</a>. I am a Computer and Communication engineering student at <a href="http://lnmiit.ac.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LNMIIT</a>, Jaipur, India.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*lyyZ67tPL2qvlvxuOHhyXA.jpeg" alt="FCC Certificate"></p><p>Two semesters had already passed and I was going nowhere. I had an interest in coding and I did some coding in C++, C and python. In the second term I was introduced to term “Web Development”. After that I didn’t know where to start from so I started trying things that again took me nowhere, one day I was going through an answer in <a href="https://www.quora.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quora</a> and came to know about FCC. I didn’t started it right through since I had my 2nd semester examinations(got “F” in two subjects), So I decided to start it in term break.</p><p>Here are some of the things that you might want to consider if you wish to complete your certification in 40 or less than 40 days:-</p><ul><li><p><strong>Set a target of at least 10 hours a day - </strong>You need to give some quality time to it. Some of the challenges will take lesser time while you may get stuck in some for days. All this needs time so be prepared to give this much time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stay healthy</strong>- I tried to maintain healthy lifestyle used to hit the gym daily, ate healthy food.<br>Still I got sick so, I was not coding for two whole days which I think was a huge loss for me. I used to sleep late in the night or call it early morning(3 am-4 am). I think this could have been better so have a proper schedule of sleeping.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don’t give up</strong>- Believe me or not you will get stuck in challenges and feel like ending your journey in FCC. But believe in yourself you will solve your challenge and feel like being in the top of the world.</p></li><li><p><strong>Read-Search-Ask</strong>- This is the first thing that you are been told when you start your FCC. You need to do it effectively. Read from trusted sources, search for resources that will help you in long run, The forum and chat rooms are really active, so ask your queries. But make sure you do it in the same sequence as mentioned.</p></li><li><p><strong>Join all the forums and social media pages related to FCC</strong>- This helps you get motivated. Here’s how : suppose you are using social media in your free time and you encounter a post in one of the pages you will open it, read it and it will remind you of working hard and keep you motivated.</p></li></ul><p>That’s all after that I will build a new portfolio page and then further strengthen my JavaScript skills. Then hop back to data visualization certification. Have a nice day, happy coding.</p>]]></content>
